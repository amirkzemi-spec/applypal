International degree | Admission requirements | MSc University of Twente Skip to main content Menu en Nederlands English Deutsch LatAm website Italian website Home Education Master Admission requirements You can do a master's if you are at an academic level . See if you are! Dutch Educational System The Dutch higher education is based on a binary system that distinguishes: Research-oriented higher education, which is mainly provided at research universities (WO Bachelor). Higher professional education, which is mainly provided at universities of applied sciences (HBO Bachelor). Being a research university , UT will focus on academically oriented work. That is why the admission committee assesses your prior education to see whether it corresponds with a bachelor's degree from a Dutch research university. Keep in mind that if you have a bachelor’s degree from a country where there is no binary system, it may differ from the bachelor’s equivalence in the Netherlands, which influences your admissibility. Read more about the education system of the Netherlands.
